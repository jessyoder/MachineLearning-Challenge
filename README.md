# MachineLearning-Challenge

## Tasks

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Performed feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Used `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separated the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tuned and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Model 1 compared the data relating to koi_steff data. 
  The training score was .639, the testing score was .627, and the overall test accuracy was .589
* Model 2 compared the koi_impact data.
  The training score was .622, the testing score was .594, and the overall test accuracy was .570
* Model 3 compared koi_slogg.
  The training score was .625, the testing score was .621, and the overall test accuracy was .575
* It appears, based on these numbers, that out of the data that I analyzed, the koi_steff data analysis had the highest accuracy.
